# GoFish Work Sample
###### A Wordpress theme created as a work sample for GoFish Digital.

This theme was developed based on the sample PSD provided. Development of this theme began with the [Underscores starter template](https://underscores.me/), which provided a solid base on which to build.

## Plugins & Dependencies
This theme depends on a handful of additional tools and pieces of software to function. Those are:
* [Bootstrap Frontend Toolkit](https://getbootstrap.com) - The majority of the CSS and responsive behaviors.
* [WP Bootstrap Navwalker](https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker) - An extension of the Wordpress walker class that is needed to correctly apply the appropriate nav CSS classes to the navmenu.
* [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) - Creates the fields needed in the wp-admin area to enter custom content.

## Menu Locations
The theme provides five Wordpress editable menu locations:
* Primary - The main menu at the top of the page.
* Footer 1 - The leftmost column of links in the footer section.
* Footer 2 - The center column of links in the footer section.
* Footer 3 - The rightmost column of links in the footer section.
* Social and Privacy - The row of links and icons at the bottom of the footer section.
