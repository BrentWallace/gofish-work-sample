#GoFish Work Sample
######A Wordpress theme created as a work sample for GoFish Digital.

Development of this theme began with the Underscores starter template (https://underscores.me/) and the Bootstrap frontend toolkit (https://getbootstrap.com/). A custom walker function was needed to apply the appropriate Bootstrap navigation menu classes, so the project incorporates the WP Bootstrap Navwalker located here https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker.

##Menu Locations
The theme provides four wordpress editable menu locations:
*Primary
*Footer 1
*Footer 2
*Footer 3
